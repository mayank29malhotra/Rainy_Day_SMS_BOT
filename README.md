# Rainy_Day_SMS_BOT

I have developed a Rainy Day SMS Bot using Python that automatically sends SMS reminders to carry an umbrella on rainy days. The bot utilizes the OpenWeatherMap API to check the weather conditions in the specified area and the Twilio SMS API to send the reminder message.
The bot is designed to run in the morning, when the weather forecast for the day is available, and sends the message to the specified phone number if it detects that it will be raining in the area that day. This feature ensures that users are reminded to carry an umbrella before leaving for the day, avoiding any inconvenience caused by unexpected rain.
I have hosted the bot on Python Anywhere, which allows us to schedule the task to run automatically every morning. This means that users do not have to manually check the weather forecast or run the bot themselves, making the process even more convenient.
This bot is very useful for the people who lives in the area where it rains frequently, it will be a great reminder for them to carry an umbrella with them and not get caught in the rain. This bot can be further enhanced by including more features like sending the message to multiple people and also by using the location services of the phone to check the weather of the current location.
